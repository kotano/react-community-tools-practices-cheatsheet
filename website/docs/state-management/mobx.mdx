## Description

Mobx applies concepts from Functional Reactive Programming and Object-Oriented design to automatically track changes to state and propagate updates. Mobx lets you create individual "store" classes and mark specific fields as "observable", then mark React components and other logic as "observers". You can directly modify those observables fields in your code, and Mox will transparently update any observer code that depends on those fields.
